## What is BodyPix?
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

### ðŸ‘‰ Tensorflow Model for segmentation in browser
    This model can be used to segment an image into pixels that are and are not part of a person, and into pixels that belong to each of twenty-four body parts. It works for multiple people in an input image or video.

## What am I doing here?

*  Used getUserMedia to stream video from webcam
*  Passed the video to a segmentation function from the API exposed by BodyPix
*  Which returns a mask
*  Already set a background on the canvas (the right)
*  Then I use canvas compositing functions to overlay the mask and the video on top of each other, and then stream it to the mask
